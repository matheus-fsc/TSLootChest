### How the Plugin Works

The TSLootChest plugin allows each player to have individual loot chests on the Terraria map. This means that the loot in each chest is unique to each player, preventing conflicts and duplication.

#### General Functionality
- **Initialization: The plugin initializes by creating a database to track player-placed chests, storing the chest's coordinates and status. It also identifies chests generated by the map for special handling.**
- **Chest Protection: Prevents players from breaking naturally generated chests, which are restored upon closing to retain items individually for each player. However, players can break chests placed by others.**
- **Item Restoration: When a player closes a naturally generated loot chest, the plugin automatically restores items based on stored item IDs and quantities. This data is stored temporarily and deleted once the chest is closed.**
- **Synchronization: Ensures that operations on chests are thread-safe to avoid conflicts or bugs when restoring items.**

### Available Commands for Players

1. **Add Chest**
   - **Command**: `/addchest <X> <Y>`
   - **Description**: Adds a chest at the specified coordinates if a valid chest exists.
   - **Example**: `/addchest 100 150`

2. **Remove Chest**
   - **Command**: `/remchest <X> <Y>`
   - **Description**: Removes a chest at the specified coordinates if the chest was placed by a player.
   - **Example**: `/remchest 100 150`

3. **Toggle Chest Log**
   - **Command**: `/togglelogchest <true|false>`
   - **Description**: Enables or disables the logging of chest openings.
   - **Example**: `/togglelogchest true`

### Additional Information

- The plugin logs events such as placing and removing chests, ensuring that all actions are recorded and verified.
- To protect chests, the plugin checks if the chest was placed by a player before allowing its removal.
